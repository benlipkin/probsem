"""
Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 are increasingly being used to generate text.
These tools should be used with care, since they can generate content that is biased, non-verifiable, constitutes original research, or fails to follow our other policies and guidelines.
Editors retain full responsibility for LLM-assisted edits, which should still comply with all relevant Wikipedia policies.
While the use of LLMs is not prohibited, their use should be reserved to experienced editors, who should carefully scrutinize their LLM-assisted edits before hitting Publish. 
The use of such programs to create whole articles or generate passages from scratch is forbidden.
Furthermore, LLM use must be declared in the edit summary.
