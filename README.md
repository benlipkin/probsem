# ProbSem

## Summary

This repository explores the efficacy of large language models trained jointly on natural text and source code to act as probabilistic semantic parsers.

This work extends the notion of using LLMs for natural language guided program synthesis from single programs to distributions over programs.

## Alpha Status

This repository is currently under development and evolving rapidly. It should be considered unstable, and more information will be made available once more established.
